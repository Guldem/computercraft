This is a repository collecting all my code for Minecraft's ComputerCraft.
Below is a short overview of the features, with detailed information in the respective folders.

  * MutsFM's Evalator Inc.
      - The primary code in this folder is used to operate an elevator system based on minecarts with a touchscreen floor selector and a request-minecart-to-floor function. It also contains code for a floor plan information screen.
      - There is no limit (discovered yet) on the amount of floors you can use it on.
      - There are two versions of code for the touchscreen floor selector: one for elevator systems with less than XX floors and one for systems with more than XX floors.
      - There are two versions of code for the information screens: one for a static information screen and one for an interactive version.
